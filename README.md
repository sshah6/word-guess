# Constructor Word Guess

* **Created:** Saturday, April 21st, 2018

* **Context:** This is the eleventh week's homework assignment as a part of the Georgia Tech Coding Bootcamp. In this assignment, we are building a NodeJS based application with interactive prompts (through the Inquirer NPM package).  The homework's high level instructions are as follows:

```
In this week's assignment, you will create a Word Guess command-line game using constructor functions.
```

* **See a quick walk-through demonstration of the game via the Constructor_Word_Guess_Walkthrough.webm file in this repository**

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

```
* You'll need to have NodeJS installed on your computer since this application has no wep-page front-end
* This application also will require you have API keys for the following:
    * https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer
    
* There are no APIs used in this application so there are no additional setup instructions regarding credential management
* Standard behavior of "npm install" should apply given the provided package.json details
```

### Prerequisites

These are things you need to install the software and how to install them:

```
see 'Getting Started' section above
```

### Installing

These are a set of step-by-step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running:

```
1.) Install NodeJS
2.) Clone Git repository
3.) Run 'npm install' from local git directory
4.) Run the file by command 'node index.js'
5.) Play the game and have a good time!
```
